            I set myself a goal in 2019: read, on average, a book per week.
            I achieved that goal, and then some. I was able to do it by
            deleting my social media feeds. Below is the list, in the order I
            read them, with some small thoughts on each book.
          </p>
          <p>
            One rule: I did not have to finish a book I wasn't enjoying. All
            of these passed that test, so consider my review for all of these a
            thumbs-up. A couple didn't pass this test, and I won't bother you with
            those.

            Hopefully no spoilers below.

                </p>
                <p>
                  What can you say about a story set partially in the land of the dead
                  and partially in an early 20th Century school for children with
                  speech impediments. This is one weird-ass book. The photos and
                  other artifacts of the ghost speakers, make it more than just a
                  novel. Not an easy thing to read, but ultimately it pays off if you
                  stick with it. <em>(512 pages)</em>

                  Well, we won't have to worry about global warming since most folks will
                  be killed by a worldwide pandemic. If you want a picture of what happens
                  to New York City when most of its inhabitants are dead or dying,
                  this is the novel for you. It was the novel for me anyway.

                If menacing dollhouses set in 17th Century Amsterdam are your cup
                of tea, you'll dig this one. Lots of period color, a mysterious maker

                actual dollhouse.

                My introduciton to N.K. Jemisin was the "Broken Earth" series. Those
                books are so cool &mdash; fantasy without dragons and swords. This
                collection of short stories was written over more than a decade, and
                while I do think they feel a bit all over the board, the author's
                storytelling makes each enjoyable.

                The characters are like cardboard cutouts, but the story of Earth’s
                first encounter with an extraterrestrial civilization is thought-provoking,

                but I couldn't get the story out of my head. I read them all, and I'm

                Take a group of people, drop them into a haunted house, and let the good

                Two young girls in a violent post-War Naples struggle to find their way
                in a world where little is expected of them. The novel was okay, but
                really sort of a soap opera. I feel like I was really supposed to

                The editor of a prison creative writing magazine is trending on
                Twitter and tries to explain why he has done the things he's done.
                Meanwhile, the rioters are coming for him. The many digs at
                Brooklyn hipsters hit close to home. It's funny, though my
                description doesn't sound very comic.

              <p>
                I know a bit about gambling, but sports betting has always been
                inscrutable. Since I have read Ed Miller's poker books in the past,
                I trust he knows his topic. I came away with a much better
                understanding of how this all works. But I'm still not planning
                to make my living as a sports bettor anytime soon. If you're
                curious about the mathematics of what "Bengals minus 6.5" means,
                you'll learn that from Ed.

                How do you test a new product idea out and make sure you're
                getting feedback that is truly helpful? People really, really
                want to be nice and tell you what you want to hear. And you are
                probably telegraphing what you want to be told.

                Well, where to begin with this short story collection? I always
                jump a the chance to read Karen Russell's stories. They are just
                weird, and none is alike. For instance, one story is about an
                old time tornado wrangler looking to raise one last beauty,
                another is about a man who falls in love with a dead girl
                preserved by Welsh bog, in another a woman becomes a Joshua tree.
                They're so inventive &mdash; each one is a gem.

                Cormoran Strike and Robin are back with some ritual disembowelment
                in the petty world of book publishing. I feel like our author is
                channeling some frustrations.

                It's not easy to stage a rebellion against an AI who knows all your
                movements and is looking out for your best interests. Also, your
                co-revolutionaries are rarely awake when you are. And you're not
                awake all that often.

                A really good board game player tries to overthrow a space empire.
                Is he a hero or a pawn in a greater game? There's also a cranky flying
                robot secret agent. One of Banks's Culture novels, but you don't

                A murder mystery and the story of a feral orphan girl converge on
                two different timelines in 1950s and 60s North Carolina swamps.
                Owens builds a lot of empathy for our heroes. This one kept me

                This is a hard one. The stories in this collection revolved around
                a town in Maryland that was the site of the only (fictional) successful
                slave revolt in America. The intertwined stories are sometimes
                magical, sometimes religious and musical, sometimes elaborately violent.
                I'm not exactly sure what I read, but it was worth reading. This is a
                follow-up set of stories to a previous collection.

                Sentient cats in New Delhi! First in a YA series, though I think

                afterward.

                It's not enough to be race neutral in a society of ingrained racist
                institutions. To move toward equity, we need to be anti-racist. All
                decisions need to be filtered through that lens. It's not easy, even
                for the targets of racist policies.

                Loneliness, desire, and regret in 1957 Southern California. Reminds
                me of Cormac McCarthy's "Border Trilogy" in style and voice. Also,
                basically everyone in 1950s America is gay. Some good Vegas content.

                Marmee, Jo, Meg, Beth, and Amy find their way in a world that doesn't
                give them a whole lot of options. I dare you to not shed a tear or
                two. The amount of petting in this novel is a little disturbing.

                Essays from the very controversial (random killing of cops might have
                utility), to the lighlty controversial (YA literature is bad), to
                homages to his dead cats (Banana and Chip), Watts has a lot to say
                on about any topic you might think of. This is a repurposing of years
                of blog posts. If you want to know more about what is in the mind of
                the author of <em>Blindsight</em> and <em>Echopraxia</em>, you should
                give this collection a read.

                  So, how does a bedraggled crew led by a scruffy criminal launch
                  a movement that becomes the state religion of the known world in
                  under 400 years? And all without social media. It's a little like
                  a virus. Even an old non-believer like me has to stand back and
                  admire the chutzpah.

                  Things are bad &mdash; like, real bad. Based on the latest IPCC
                  report, they're even worse than this book makes out. The outlook
                  presented is so dire, it took me several months to finish the
                  book because I just couldn't read it through. Ultimately there
                  is some hope offered, but not much.

                  A collection from a master short story teller, these stories have
                  the same things I love about Karen Russell's stories. Each is so
                  perfectly formed I wonder how it could possibly exist. The
                  title story is so human, you quickly lose track of the fact the
                  narrator is one of a race of inquisitive robots facing a very
                  familiar existential threat.

                <p>
                  How does a man who is literally out of control, blasted on cocaine
                  and vodka at all times, build a huge multi-national media
                  empire? It's never quite clear, but it it did happen. I work at
                  the company he ultimately created. The names drop fast and
                  hard in this self-hagiography (albeit with some self-reflection
                  on just what an ass he was). Return with Walter to the days when
                  hookers and blow made the music business run.

                <p>
                  The only ancient novel written in Latin to survive, our hero Lucius
                  accidentally turns himself into an ass. Wackiness ensues. The
                  women are all conniving or stupid and the men are mostly beastly or
                  stupid. The gods are real assholes. There are truly funny moments
                  and modern-seeming situations. Those Romans sure did have a lot of
                  sex and in a lot of different ways.
